					<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
					<div class="name-zig"></div>
					
					<div class="col-xs-12">
						<p>Focus India Theological College is a training institution, in Nilambur, A municipal town, in the  Malappuram District of the state of Kerala, South India. Focus India College came into existence in the year 1999. The college has different functions such as Social, Religious and other activities.</p>
<h3>Major areas of work: </h3>
<h4>1. HOLISTIC TRAINING OF YOUNG PEOPLE</h4>
						<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-circle btn-lg"></span>One of the major programs of the College is the training of young people. It was for this purpose that the College was started with a passion to work for the overall development of individuals, families and communities based on the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>
While the graduates of the college are working in different parts of India, the special focus is on Malabar, which is comprised of the six revenue districts of the State of Kerala, South India. Malabar has a mixture of all religions, although it has a majority population consisting of Muslims and Hindus.
</p>

<p>
Focus India Theological College trains committed young Christians from different parts of India to fulfil the great Commission of our Lord Jesus Christ- Making disciples of all nations. Along with the theological education, the college offers an opportunity for the students to gain a secular B. A  degree in sociology from Calicut University. Students can enroll for the B.A. degree under Calicut University provided that they have passed their high school(12th / +2).
</p>


</div>
<div class="col-xs-12">

<p>
Our main aim is to give both secular as well as religious education to young people who are interested in the overall development of their personal lives and in turn make a difference in families, communities and society at large. 
</p>
<p>
Our student body consist of students from different states of India but at the same time we make sure that we have a good number of students from some of the backward states of North India and especially from the rural areas who are denied of higher education due to different reasons like economic backwardness and other related reasons.</p>
<p>
We want to see that by the time they complete three years with us in Focus India college, they get a B.Th (Bachelor of Theology) and a B.A in sociology from Calicut University. We make sure they are holistically trained and ready to go back to their own places with a vision to develop communities, drawing their inspiration from the Bible and especially from the Gospels- the teachings of Christ. 
</p>
<p>
We have four full time teachers and five part time teachers who are committed in training our students. We also have two other teachers who come in the afternoon to help with the B.A degree coaching for our students. 
</p>

						<p>Our total expenses to run this college is about three Lakhs ($4500) a month, which includes all the teacher’s salary, food and accommodation expenses for all the students, the office expenses, cook’s salary and other miscellaneous expenses like electricity charges, telephone charges, travel expenses etc. 
</p>
<p>
Since we do not collect fees from the students on a regular basis for their training, we subsidise almost 100% of their expenses. (A few students give some donations when they can but not on a regular basis). 
</p>
<p> 
It is here that we look for friends who can support us not only through their prayers but even financially.
We request our well-wishers and friends who are interested in the development of young lives who can make a difference in thier communities/ societies to help us support one or two students on a monthly basis. The total expense for a student for a month comes to five thousand rupees which will cover his tuition fee, boarding and lodging, and expenses for his B.A degree course. 
</p>

<p><b>WE HUMBLY REQUEST ALL OUR WELLWISHERS AND FRIENDS TO HELP ONE OR TWO STUDENTS ON A REGULAR BASIS SO THAT THEY CAN COMPLETE THEIR STUDIES</b></p>
<p> 
<br>
</p><h4>2. HELPING THE LESS PRIVILEGED CHILDREN IN COMMUNITIES</h4>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-circle btn-lg"></span>Helping school going children irrespective of their caste, creed or religion at the beginning of the academic year. The college has been helping about 100 school going children at the beginning of every academic year with their initial expenses like buying note books, uniforms, school bags etc. This year (2016) we plan to have it on the 25th of May 2016. We have invited almost 100 children to come and receive the financial help. <p></p>

<p> Would you be willing to help one or two children from the less privileged family background for his/her education? To help a child for a full academic year with his/her basic needs such as a school bag, 2 pair of uniforms, their notebooks and textbooks etc, they need Rs.5000(five thousand).
</p>

<h4>3.SUPPORT FOR OUR GRADUATES IN THE FIELD.</h4>

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-circle btn-lg"></span>We are earnestly looking for friends who can help a graduate to pioneer a new work in a rural area especially in the northern part on India. All our graduates need initial help for at least three years before they can become self-sufficient. Rs.5000 a month can help a graduate to start a new work!

<p><b>WE THANK OUR READERS AND WELL-WISHERS FOR YOUR PRAYERS. PLEASE CONSIDER AT LEAST ONE OF THE ABOVE PROGRAMS AND HELP US.</b>

				<br>
				<div class="col-lg-offset-3 col-lg-6">
				<p>
				<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok btn-lg"></span>
				Authority of God’s Word
				</p>
				<p>The Bible, both the Old and New Testaments, is inspired by God. It is the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct (1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:15-17; 2 Peter 1:21). 
</p>
<p>
				<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok btn-lg"></span>
				One True God
				</p>
				<p>There is one true God who has revealed himself as Father, Son and Holy Spirit (Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 43:10, 11; Matthew 28:19; Luke 3:22). 
</p>
				


<p>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok btn-lg"></span>
Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ
</p>
<p>
The Lord Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God. The Scriptures declare:
</p><ol>
<li>His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31, 35)</li>
<li>His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).</li>
<li>His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).</li>
<li>His substitutionary work on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).</li>
<li>His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; 1 Corinthians. 15:4).</li>
<li>His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9, 11; 2:33; Philippians 2:9-11; Hebrews 1:3).</li>
</ol>

<p>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok btn-lg"></span>Fall of Man
</p>
<p>
Man was created good and upright but by voluntary transgression fell and thereby incurred physical and spiritual death, which is separation from God (Genesis 1:26, 27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12-19).
</p>
<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok btn-lg"></span>
Salvation of Man
</p>
<p>
Man’s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
Conditions to salvation: Salvation is received through repentance towards God and faith towards the Lord Jesus Christ (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13-15; Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11; 3:5-7).
</li>
<li>
Evidences of Salvation: The inward evidence is the direct witness of the Spirit (Romans 8:16). The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and holiness (Ephesians 4:24; Titus 2:12).
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok btn-lg"></span>
Ordinances of the Church
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
Baptism in water by immersion is commanded in the Scriptures. All who repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. This declares to the world that they have died with Christ and been raised with Him to walk in newness of life (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 10:47, 48; Romans 6:4).
</li>
<li>Holy Communion or the Lord’s Supper consists of the elements- bread and the fruit of the vine. It is a symbol of our sharing the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4); a reminder of His suffering and death (1 Corinthians 11:26); and prophesy of His Second Coming (1 Corinthians 11:26).
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok btn-lg"></span>
Baptism in the Holy Spirit
</p>
<p>
All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek the baptism of the Holy Spirit. With it comes inducement of power for life and service (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4, 8; 1 Corinthians 12:1-31). 
</p>
<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok btn-lg"></span>
Sanctification
</p>
<p>
Sanctification is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication to God (Romans 12:1, 2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). Scriptures teach a life of “Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14).
</p>
<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok btn-lg"></span>
Church and its Mission</p>
<p>
The Church is the body of Christ of which each believer is a part (Ephesians 1:22, 23; 2:22; Hebrews 12:23).
</p>
<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok btn-lg"></span>
Ministry </p>
<p>
A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry is for the threefold purpose of leading the church in evangelizing the world (Mark 16:15-20); worshipping God (John 4:23, 24); building a body of saints being perfected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11, 16).
</p>
<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok btn-lg"></span>
Divine Healing</p>

<p>Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel, provided for in the Atonement and is the privilege of all believers (Isaiah 53:4, 5; Matthew 8:16, 17; James 5:14-16). 
</p>
<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok btn-lg"></span>
Blessed Hope

<p>
The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their rapture together with those who are alive at the coming of the Lord is the imminent and blessed hope of the Church (Romans 8:23; Titus 2:11-14, 1 Corinthians 15:51; 1 Thessalonians 4:16).

Millennial Reign of Christ
</p>
<p>
The Second coming of Christ includes the rapture of Church, which is our blessed hope, followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to reign on the earth for 1,000 years (Zechariah 14:5; Matthew 24:27, 30; Revelation 1:7; 19:11-14; 20:1-6).

Final Judgment 
</p>
<p>
There will be a final judgment of the wicked dead according to their works. Whoever is not found written in the Book of Life will be consigned to everlasting punishment on the lake of fire (Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43-48; Revelation 19:20; 20:11-15; 21:8).

“We, according to his promise, look for the new heaven and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness” (2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21:22).
